through the appropriation of the faith of jesus, mortal man can foretaste in time the realities of eternity. jesus made the discovery, in human experience, of the final father, and his brothers in the flesh of mortal life can follow him along this same experience of father discovery. they can even attain, as they are, the same satisfaction in this experience with the father as did jesus as he was. new potentials were actualized in the universe of nebadon consequent upon the terminal bestowal of michael, and one of these was the new illumination of the path of eternity that leads to the father of all, and which can be traversed even by the mortals of material flesh and blood in the initial life on the planets of space. jesus was and is the new and living way whereby man can come into the divine inheritance which the father has decreed shall be his for but the asking. in jesus there is abundantly demonstrated both the beginnings and endings of the faith experience of humanity, even of divine humanity.
