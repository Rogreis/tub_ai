never can there be either scientific or logical proofs of divinity. reason alone can never validate the values and goodnesses of religious experience. but it will always remain true: whosoever wills to do the will of god shall comprehend the validity of spiritual values. this is the nearest approach that can be made on the mortal level to offering proofs of the reality of religious experience. such faith affords the only escape from the mechanical clutch of the material world and from the error distortion of the incompleteness of the intellectual world; it is the only discovered solution to the impasse in mortal thinking regarding the continuing survival of the individual personality. it is the only passport to completion of reality and to eternity of life in a universal creation of love, law, unity, and progressive deity attainment.
