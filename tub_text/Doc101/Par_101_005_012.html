evolved religion rests wholly on faith. revelation has the additional assurance of its expanded presentation of the truths of divinity and reality and the still more valuable testimony of the actual experience which accumulates in consequence of the practical working union of the faith of evolution and the truth of revelation. such a working union of human faith and divine truth constitutes the possession of a character well on the road to the actual acquirement of a morontial personality.
