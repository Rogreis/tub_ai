the purpose of religion is not to satisfy curiosity about god but rather to afford intellectual constancy and philosophic security, to stabilize and enrich human living by blending the mortal with the divine, the partial with the perfect, man and god. it is through religious experience that manâ€™s concepts of ideality are endowed with reality.
