the realization of religion never has been, and never will be, dependent on great learning or clever logic. it is spiritual insight, and that is just the reason why some of the worldâ€™s greatest religious teachers, even the prophets, have sometimes possessed so little of the wisdom of the world. religious faith is available alike to the learned and the unlearned.
