faith reveals god in the soul. revelation, the substitute for morontia insight on an evolutionary world, enables man to see the same god in nature that faith exhibits in his soul. thus does revelation successfully bridge the gulf between the material and the spiritual, even between the creature and the creator, between man and god.
