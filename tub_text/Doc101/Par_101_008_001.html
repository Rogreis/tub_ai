belief has attained the level of faith when it motivates life and shapes the mode of living. the acceptance of a teaching as true is not faith; that is mere belief. neither is certainty nor conviction faith. a state of mind attains to faith levels only when it actually dominates the mode of living. faith is a living attribute of genuine personal religious experience. one believes truth, admires beauty, and reverences goodness, but does not worship them; such an attitude of saving faith is centered on god alone, who is all of these personified and infinitely more.
