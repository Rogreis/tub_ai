the divine spirit makes contact with mortal man, not by feelings or emotions, but in the realm of the highest and most spiritualized thinking. it is your thoughts, not your feelings, that lead you godward. the divine nature may be perceived only with the eyes of the mind. but the mind that really discerns god, hears the indwelling adjuster, is the pure mind. “without holiness no man may see the lord.” all such inner and spiritual communion is termed spiritual insight. such religious experiences result from the impress made upon the mind of man by the combined operations of the adjuster and the spirit of truth as they function amid and upon the ideas, ideals, insights, and spirit strivings of the evolving sons of god.
