true religion is that sublime and profound conviction within the soul which compellingly admonishes man that it would be wrong for him not to believe in those morontial realities which constitute his highest ethical and moral concepts, his highest interpretation of life’s greatest values and the universe’s deepest realities. and such a religion is simply the experience of yielding intellectual loyalty to the highest dictates of spiritual consciousness.
