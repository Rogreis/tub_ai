the great difference between a religious and a nonreligious philosophy of living consists in the nature and level of recognized values and in the object of loyalties. there are four phases in the evolution of religious philosophy: such an experience may become merely conformative, resigned to submission to tradition and authority. or it may be satisfied with slight attainments, just enough to stabilize the daily living, and therefore becomes early arrested on such an adventitious level. such mortals believe in letting well enough alone. a third group progress to the level of logical intellectuality but there stagnate in consequence of cultural slavery. it is indeed pitiful to behold giant intellects held so securely within the cruel grasp of cultural bondage. it is equally pathetic to observe those who trade their cultural bondage for the materialistic fetters of a science, falsely so called. the fourth level of philosophy attains freedom from all conventional and traditional handicaps and dares to think, act, and live honestly, loyally, fearlessly, and truthfully.
