because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide instruction in cosmology. and always has this made trouble for the future. the laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time. accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.
