religion effectually cures manâ€™s sense of idealistic isolation or spiritual loneliness; it enfranchises the believer as a son of god, a citizen of a new and meaningful universe. religion assures man that, in following the gleam of righteousness discernible in his soul, he is thereby identifying himself with the plan of the infinite and the purpose of the eternal. such a liberated soul immediately begins to feel at home in this new universe, his universe.
