an idea is only a theoretical plan for action, while a positive decision is a validated plan of action. a stereotype is a plan of action accepted without validation. the materials out of which to build a personal philosophy of religion are derived from both the inner and the environmental experience of the individual. the social status, economic conditions, educational opportunities, moral trends, institutional influences, political developments, racial tendencies, and the religious teachings of one’s time and place all become factors in the formulation of a personal philosophy of religion. even the inherent temperament and intellectual bent markedly determine the pattern of religious philosophy. vocation, marriage, and kindred all influence the evolution of one’s personal standards of life.
