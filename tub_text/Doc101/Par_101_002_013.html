true religion is an insight into reality, the faith-child of the moral consciousness, and not a mere intellectual assent to any body of dogmatic doctrines. true religion consists in the experience that “the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god.” religion consists not in theologic propositions but in spiritual insight and the sublimity of the soul’s trust.
