faith has falsified its trust when it presumes to deny realities and to confer upon its devotees assumed knowledge. faith is a traitor when it fosters betrayal of intellectual integrity and belittles loyalty to supreme values and divine ideals. faith never shuns the problem-solving duty of mortal living. living faith does not foster bigotry, persecution, or intolerance.
