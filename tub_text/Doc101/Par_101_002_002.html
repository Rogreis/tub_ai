reason is the method of science; faith is the method of religion; logic is the attempted technique of philosophy. revelation compensates for the absence of the morontia viewpoint by providing a technique for achieving unity in the comprehension of the reality and relationships of matter and spirit by the mediation of mind. and true revelation never renders science unnatural, religion unreasonable, or philosophy illogical.
