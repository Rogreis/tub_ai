science ends its reason-search in the hypothesis of a first cause. religion does not stop in its flight of faith until it is sure of a god of salvation. the discriminating study of science logically suggests the reality and existence of an absolute. religion believes unreservedly in the existence and reality of a god who fosters personality survival. what metaphysics fails utterly in doing, and what even philosophy fails partially in doing, revelation does; that is, affirms that this first cause of science and religionâ€™s god of salvation are one and the same deity.
