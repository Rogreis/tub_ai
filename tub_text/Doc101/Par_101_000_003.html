religion, the conviction-faith of the personality, can always triumph over the superficially contradictory logic of despair born in the unbelieving material mind. there really is a true and genuine inner voice, that “true light which lights every man who comes into the world.” and this spirit leading is distinct from the ethical prompting of human conscience. the feeling of religious assurance is more than an emotional feeling. the assurance of religion transcends the reason of the mind, even the logic of philosophy. religion is faith, trust, and assurance.
