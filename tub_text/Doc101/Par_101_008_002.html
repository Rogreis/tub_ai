belief is always limiting and binding; faith is expanding and releasing. belief fixates, faith liberates. but living religious faith is more than the association of noble beliefs; it is more than an exalted system of philosophy; it is a living experience concerned with spiritual meanings, divine ideals, and supreme values; it is god-knowing and man-serving. beliefs may become group possessions, but faith must be personal. theologic beliefs can be suggested to a group, but faith can rise up only in the heart of the individual religionist.
