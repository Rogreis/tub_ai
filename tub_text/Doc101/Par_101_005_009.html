scientists assemble facts, philosophers co-ordinate ideas, while prophets exalt ideals. feeling and emotion are invariable concomitants of religion, but they are not religion. religion may be the feeling of experience, but it is hardly the experience of feeling. neither logic (rationalization) nor emotion (feeling) is essentially a part of religious experience, although both may variously be associated with the exercise of faith in the furtherance of spiritual insight into reality, all according to the status and temperamental tendency of the individual mind.
