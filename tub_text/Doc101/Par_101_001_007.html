thus it may be seen that religious longings and spiritual urges are not of such a nature as would merely lead men to want to believe in god, but rather are they of such nature and power that men are profoundly impressed with the conviction that they ought to believe in god. the sense of evolutionary duty and the obligations consequent upon the illumination of revelation make such a profound impression upon man’s moral nature that he finally reaches that position of mind and that attitude of soul where he concludes that he has no right not to believe in god. the higher and superphilosophic wisdom of such enlightened and disciplined individuals ultimately instructs them that to doubt god or distrust his goodness would be to prove untrue to the realest and deepest thing within the human mind and soul — the divine adjuster.
