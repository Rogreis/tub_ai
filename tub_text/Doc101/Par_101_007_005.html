the acid test for any religious philosophy consists in whether or not it distinguishes between the realities of the material and the spiritual worlds while at the same moment recognizing their unification in intellectual striving and in social serving. a sound religious philosophy does not confound the things of god with the things of caesar. neither does it recognize the aesthetic cult of pure wonder as a substitute for religion.
