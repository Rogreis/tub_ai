the contemplation of nature can only reveal a god of nature, a god of motion. nature exhibits only matter, motion, and animation â€” life. matter plus energy, under certain conditions, is manifested in living forms, but while natural life is thus relatively continuous as a phenomenon, it is wholly transient as to individualities. nature does not afford ground for logical belief in human-personality survival. the religious man who finds god in nature has already and first found this same personal god in his own soul.
