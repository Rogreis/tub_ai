such a sevenfold salvation is the equivalent of the completeness and perfection of the realization of the ultimate experience of the universal father. and all this, in potential, is contained within the reality of the faith of the human experience of religion. and it can be so contained since the faith of jesus was nourished by, and was revelatory of, even realities beyond the ultimate; the faith of jesus approached the status of a universe absolute in so far as such is possible of manifestation in the evolving cosmos of time and space.
