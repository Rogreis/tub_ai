religion is so vital that it persists in the absence of learning. it lives in spite of its contamination with erroneous cosmologies and false philosophies; it survives even the confusion of metaphysics. in and through all the historic vicissitudes of religion there ever persists that which is indispensable to human progress and survival: the ethical conscience and the moral consciousness.
