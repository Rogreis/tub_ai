religion is the ancestor of the advanced ethics and morals of progressive social evolution. but religion, as such, is not merely a moral movement, albeit the outward and social manifestations of religion are mightily influenced by the ethical and moral momentum of human society. always is religion the inspiration of manâ€™s evolving nature, but it is not the secret of that evolution.
