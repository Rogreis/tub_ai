faith does not shackle the creative imagination, neither does it maintain an unreasoning prejudice toward the discoveries of scientific investigation. faith vitalizes religion and constrains the religionist heroically to live the golden rule. the zeal of faith is according to knowledge, and its strivings are the preludes to sublime peace.
