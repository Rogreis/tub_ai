it is only through the morontial avenue leading to spiritual insight that man can ever break the fetters inherent in his mortal status in the universe. energy and mind do lead back to paradise and deity, but neither the energy endowment nor the mind endowment of man proceeds directly from such paradise deity. only in the spiritual sense is man a child of god. and this is true because it is only in the spiritual sense that man is at present endowed and indwelt by the paradise father. mankind can never discover divinity except through the avenue of religious experience and by the exercise of true faith. the faith acceptance of the truth of god enables man to escape from the circumscribed confines of material limitations and affords him a rational hope of achieving safe conduct from the material realm, whereon is death, to the spiritual realm, wherein is life eternal.
