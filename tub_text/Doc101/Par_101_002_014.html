your deepest nature — the divine adjuster — creates within you a hunger and thirst for righteousness, a certain craving for divine perfection. religion is the faith act of the recognition of this inner urge to divine attainment; and thus is brought about that soul trust and assurance of which you become conscious as the way of salvation, the technique of the survival of personality and all those values which you have come to look upon as being true and good.
