mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors. we are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. we see no way of overcoming this difficulty, either now or at any future time. we full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. these new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. the cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. it is limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of present-day knowledge. while divine or spiritual insight is a gift, human wisdom must evolve.
