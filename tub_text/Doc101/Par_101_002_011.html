the contemplation of nature does logically point in the direction of intelligent guidance, even living supervision, but it does not in any satisfactory manner reveal a personal god. on the other hand, nature discloses nothing which would preclude the universe from being looked upon as the handiwork of the god of religion. god cannot be found through nature alone, but man having otherwise found him, the study of nature becomes wholly consistent with a higher and more spiritual interpretation of the universe.
