the evolutionary type of knowledge is but the accumulation of protoplasmic memory material; this is the most primitive form of creature consciousness. wisdom embraces the ideas formulated from protoplasmic memory in process of association and recombination, and such phenomena differentiate human mind from mere animal mind. animals have knowledge, but only man possesses wisdom capacity. truth is made accessible to the wisdom-endowed individual by the bestowal on such a mind of the spirits of the father and the sons, the thought adjuster and the spirit of truth.
